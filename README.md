# Bioinformatics

I am very interested in the field of Bioinformatics and have had an introduction
with my [capstone project](https://github.com/jakesauter/Molecular_Classification_Capstone/blob/master/README.md)
in the machine learning classification of cancer type by gene expression levels. After this project
I have wanted to delve in deeper to the field of Bioinformatics, and this repository is my 
attempt to do so.

I did continue on after my capstone project to attempt to learn more using the [Rosalind.info](rosalind.info)
website, though I ran into a problem that required knowledge of a fairly robust algorithm that 
I was not aware of, so I realized that I had to acheive a much more in depth introduction to the 
field, leading me to ...  

## Phase 1: An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms By Niel C Jones and Pavel A Pevzner

This book was recommended by some on the [Rosalind.info](rosalind.info) site, and some of the problems
on the site are actually adaptions from this book! This means that as I am reading this book and 
delving deeper into the field, I do not have to drop my goal of completing all of the problems 
on the [Rosalind.info](rosalind.info) site, but can pick up where I left off when I catch back up!
